Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today we gather to discuss a story—a story about innovation, about the evolution of technology, and about the way we, as a society, navigate the waters of progress. I stand before you representing a group of pioneers, Microsoft Corporation and the various entities of OpenAI, who have dedicated themselves to advancing artificial intelligence for the betterment of all.

Imagine, if you will, a world where technology serves as a tool to enhance human creativity, to answer our questions, and to solve problems that once seemed insurmountable. This is the world that Microsoft and OpenAI strive to create—a world where artificial intelligence, like the GenAI tools and GPT-4, are not just dreams of science fiction but tangible realities improving our daily lives.

Now, The New York Times, a respected institution with a rich history of over 170 years, has brought forth a complaint. They claim that our efforts to build these innovative tools have unlawfully used their work. They say that we have taken a "free-ride" on their investment in journalism. But this is not a story of theft or harm; this is a story of transformation and progress.

Our use of publicly available data, including content from various sources, is not to replicate but to learn, to understand language, and to generate new, independent content. This is a common practice in the tech industry, necessary for the advancement of AI technology. It is not a substitute for the original work but a step towards a future where AI can assist us in ways we are only beginning to understand.

We believe in the principle of fair use, a doctrine that supports the use of material for transformative purposes. Our AI does not simply regurgitate information; it creates, it innovates, and it serves a new purpose entirely separate from the original. This is the essence of transformation, and it is at the heart of fair use.

The Times has not shown us specific instances where our work has directly copied theirs in a way that would constitute infringement. They have not demonstrated how our actions have caused them actual damage. Instead, they ask for billions in damages and for a permanent injunction that would not only stifle innovation but also set a dangerous precedent for the future of technology.

We respect the work of The New York Times. We understand the value of journalism as a beacon of truth. But we also believe in the power of technology to work alongside such institutions, to expand our capabilities, and to bring forth a new era of information and understanding.

As we proceed with this case, I ask you to consider the broader implications of the claims before us. Think about the future we are building and the role that artificial intelligence plays in it. Consider the true meaning of transformation and the spirit of innovation that drives us forward.

We are confident that, as you hear the evidence and understand the context, you will see that this is not a case of infringement but one of progress. We trust that you will find that Microsoft and OpenAI have acted lawfully, with respect for the rights of others, and with a vision for a better tomorrow.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to presenting our case.
