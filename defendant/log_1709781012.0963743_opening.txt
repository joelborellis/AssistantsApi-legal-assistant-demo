Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today we gather to discuss a story that intertwines the rich history of journalism with the cutting-edge advancements of artificial intelligence. This is a story about progress, about the evolution of how we share and create knowledge, and about the respect for the hard work that goes into crafting the news stories we all rely on.

Imagine, if you will, a company like The New York Times, a beacon of journalism for over 170 years, standing strong like a lighthouse guiding ships through foggy nights. Now, picture a group of innovators, people like Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Sam Altman, and Greg Brockman, who, along with their teams at Microsoft and OpenAI, are sailing into uncharted waters, bringing forth advancements like GPT-3 and ChatGPT that could redefine how we interact with information.

The New York Times, concerned about the use of its content, reached out to these innovators in April 2023. They were worried that their hard work was being used without permission, that it was fueling the engines of a new kind of ship that they didn't understand, one that could potentially sail faster and further than their own.

But here's where our paths diverge. The folks at Microsoft and OpenAI, they're not pirates. They're not out to steal or to harm. They're explorers, using bits and pieces of information from all over the world to build something that can benefit us all. They believe, and we agree, that what they're doing is transformative. It's not just about repeating what's been said before; it's about creating something new, something that can answer our questions, help our children learn, and maybe even make us laugh.

The New York Times says that this new creation is taking away from their business, that it's like someone is free-riding on their hard work. But the truth is, these AI models, they're not competing with journalists. They're not taking away the need for the insightful analysis and the in-depth reporting that The Times provides. They're something different, something new.

And let's talk about innovation, about the public good that comes from pushing the boundaries of what's possible. If we put up walls around the information that these AI models learn from, we're not just stopping Microsoft and OpenAI; we're holding back the tide of progress that could benefit schools, businesses, and families everywhere.

We're here to show you that the work of Microsoft and OpenAI isn't about undermining journalism. It's about building on the wealth of human knowledge to create tools that can help us all. It's about respecting the past while boldly stepping into the future.

So, as we move forward, I ask you to keep an open mind. Think about the world we want to live in, about the balance between protecting the work of the past and nurturing the seeds of the future. This isn't just a case about copyright; it's a story about the journey we're all on together, in a world that's always changing, always growing.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to walking through this story with you.
