May it please the court,

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we are here today to address a matter of critical importance not only to The New York Times Company, our esteemed plaintiff, but also to the very fabric of our democracy and the sanctity of intellectual property rights. The New York Times, an institution with a storied history of delivering high-quality, independent journalism, stands before you as a guardian of truth, a beacon of free speech, and a victim of unlawful exploitation by the defendants, Microsoft and OpenAI.

The Times's commitment to democracy is unwavering, and its role in our society is irreplaceable. Yet, the defendants have threatened this role by unlawfully using The Times's copyrighted work to create and enhance AI products that directly compete with The Times, thereby undermining its ability to continue providing the quality journalism upon which we all rely.

The defendants have built their AI tools, including Microsoft's Bing Chat and OpenAI's ChatGPT, on the back of The Times's intellectual labor, training their large language models on millions of articles crafted by The Times's journalists—without permission, without payment, and without regard for the law. This is not just a violation of copyright; it is a violation of trust and an assault on the principles that govern our creative industries.

The Constitution and the Copyright Act exist to protect creators, to ensure that they have exclusive rights over their works, and to encourage the continued production of original content. The defendants have chosen to ignore these protections, and their AI tools have generated outputs that not only recite and summarize The Times's content but also, at times, attribute false information to The Times, damaging its reputation and eroding the trust between The Times and its readers.

The consequences of the defendants' actions are not abstract. They are real and measurable. The Times has suffered a deprivation of revenue—revenue that is essential for the sustenance of quality journalism—from subscriptions, licensing, advertising, and affiliate links. The defendants, on the other hand, have reaped significant financial benefits from their infringement, with increases in market capitalization and valuation that have come at the expense of The Times's hard-earned intellectual property.

Despite The Times's good faith efforts to negotiate for the fair use of its content, the defendants have remained intransigent, hiding behind a misapplication of the "fair use" doctrine. There is nothing transformative about stripping a creator of their rights and using their content to create substitutive products that serve to line the pockets of the infringer.

The Times now seeks justice. Justice in the form of statutory and actual damages for the unlawful copying and use of its uniquely valuable works. Justice in the form of restitution for profits made from the exploitation of its content. Justice in the form of a permanent injunction to halt the defendants' infringing conduct.

We are confident that the evidence will show that the defendants' actions constitute willful infringement, that they have profited immensely from their unlawful conduct, and that The Times has suffered significant financial and reputational harm as a result. The Times has always stood ready to license its content for fair compensation, a principle that the defendants have chosen to disregard, causing further economic injury to our plaintiff.

We are here in the Southern District of New York, where jurisdiction and venue are proper, to ask you to hold the defendants accountable for their actions. The Times demands, and is entitled to, a jury trial to seek the remedies it justly deserves.

Ladies and gentlemen, as you listen to the evidence presented in this case, we ask you to consider the implications of the defendants' actions on the future of journalism, on the protection of intellectual property, and on the rule of law. We trust that you will find in favor of The New York Times Company, not only to rectify the wrongs committed against it but also to uphold the values that are essential to the continued vitality of our free society.

Thank you.
